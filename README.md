# About app
It is developed as part of a coding challenge. The app is built using react-bootstrap for design, axios for fetching and react-testing-library for testing.
Context API has been used for state management. Like many other things, this might not be the most perfect app. It requires some changes, for example addition of No data found screen, adding 7 different Images and then rendering them on base of their value in response, better css etc.  Intention was to provide full functionality and it does what the challenge asked. Hope you enjoy it.
